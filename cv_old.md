Work I'm especially proud of:

<br />
**2020 - Current**

### Creating a envelop budgeting desktop application

[![logo and header of budgetbudget](/assets/budgetbudgetheader.png)](https://github.com/Xiphe/budgetbudget)

For managing personal finances, I really like the full local approach of [MoneyMoney](https://moneymoney-app.com/) + As a former [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) user
I was really disappointed to see them moving to a saas model.  
Thats why I'm creating an electron based, local only budgeting solution that 
works hand in hand with MoneyMoney and keeps the users data on his machine.

<br />
**2019 - Current**

### Providing rocket-fast feedback for unknowns in product concepts

With my company Schubrakede we're helping companies to
evaluate new ideas in the fastest possible way with manageable expenditure in time
and money.

<br />
**Summer 2019**

### Managing the conversion of cotype from an internal project to Open Source

[![logo of cotype](/assets/cotype.svg)](https://github.com/cotype/core)

After working on Cotype for client projects of [Cellular](https://www.cellular.de/)
for a while, the company decided to make the project open source. 
I managed and executed the move with a focus on continuous integration, automated
releases, additional test coverage and integration with common open source tools
like Circle CI, Codecov and Greenkeeper.

<br />
**2017 Q3 - 2018 Q2+**

### Creation of a Component Library Hosting Platform

![patternson logo](/assets/patternson_logo.png)

Gathering all the learnings from past gigs, my brother [Lasse Diercks](https://lassediercks.de/) 
and me created the groundwork of a hosting platform for technology-agnostic 
components. 

ðŸ’¥ The project is discontinued because the personal time investment was 
to much and we moved on to other endeavours.

<br />
**2018 Q1**

### Development of an open source styleguide plugin for nuxt.js

Following the vision to increase quality and efficiency of product design and 
development workflows by enabling a team to create abstractions around user
interface related decisions. We came up with [nuxt-styleguide](https://sumcumo.github.io/nuxt-styleguide/) as a tool to support this.


<br />
**2017 Q1-2**

### Bootstrapping of XING Brewery - an interface library and development environment for a multi-million user social network 

My focus was architectural component design, lean tooling and workflows, cross-team communication and overall code quality.  
The tool is now providing the technical fundament for all web development teams and
had a deep impact on product quality and development speed.

<br />
**2015 - 2016** 

### Jimdo UI Library

![Example Screenshot of the UI Library](/assets/ui-library.png)

The Jimdo UI library is a design and development environment and process that successfully reduced development time and unified the appearance of the product. It played a significant role in a comprehensive redesign mid 2016.
I was the lead developer for technical concepts and implementation. Initially I envisioned and started this project along with [Fabian Fabian](https://twitter.com/filtercake) and my brother [Lasse Diercks](https://twitter.com/lassediercks).  
A part of the project is visible as the [Jimdo UI Hub](http://jimdo.github.io/ui-library/).

<br />
**2015 - 2016**

### Modernising tooling/CD all internal front-end dependencies of Jimdo

I moved 20+ front-end modules (OSS and private) from bower, grunt/gulp, manual versioning, testing, releasing to a state of the art front-end tooling stack using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), [travis ci](https://travis-ci.org/) and so on.

<br />
**2014 - 2015** 

### Jimdo Template Selection and and Customisation

![Example Screenshot of the Jimdo Template Selection](/assets/template-selection.png)

Along with one of the best teams I've ever worked with, I've created the current templating and customisation system of Jimdo. Focussing on front-end architecture, front-end tooling, user experience, integration with our legacy stack and data-driven development of related systems.
