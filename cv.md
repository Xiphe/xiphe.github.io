### Work I am especially proud of

<br />
	
## Creation of an interface library for a multi-million user Social-Network *(2017 Q1-2)*

Focussing on architectural component design, lean tooling and workflows, cross team communication and overall code quality.

<br />

## Jimdo UI Library *(2015 - 2016)*

![Example Screenshot of the UI Library](/assets/ui-library.png)

The Jimdo UI Library is a design and development environment and process that successfully reduced
development time, unified the appearance of the product and played a significant role in a comprehensive redesign mid 2016.
I was the lead developer for technical concepts such as implementation after I envisioned and started this project along with [Fabian Fabian](https://twitter.com/filtercake) and my brother [Lasse Diercks](https://twitter.com/lassediercks).  
A part of the project is visible as the [Jimdo UI Hub](http://jimdo.github.io/ui-library/).

<br />

## Modernising tooling/CD all internal front-end dependencies of Jimdo *(2015-2016)*

Moved 20+ front-end modules (OSS and private) from bower, grunt/gulp, manual versioning, testing,
releasing to a state of the art front-end tooling stack using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), [travis ci](https://travis-ci.org/), ...

<br />

## Jimdo Template Selection and and Customisation *(2014 - 2015)*

![Example Screenshot of the Jimdo Template Selection](/assets/template-selection.png)

Concept and implementation of the current templating and customisation system. Focussing on front-end architecture, user experience, integration with the legacy system and data-driven development of related systems.

<br />

## Converting people to use and utilize commit message formats *(2014 - present)*

I'm an ambassador of writing meaningfull commit messages and maintaining a usefull git commit log.
It not only eases up the work of my fellow developers and future me, it also enables a tremendous amount
of automatisation and tools.

I've held a talk about that on JS-Unconf 2016. [Here are the slides "stop writing commitMESSages"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EXXRzbT17rbD7CFXugPZgvgMhsoVE1XXSA7UxBl3iXw/edit?usp=sharing
)
