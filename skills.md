**JavaScript (ES5-latest), git, Node.js, React, Redux, npm (scripts and api), Jest (or Jasmine, Mocha, Sinon.JS), GitHub (integrations), HTML, CSS (or less, sass etc.), webpack, Express, Nightwatch.js (or similar end-to-end test frameworks), ...**

## Soft and Secondary Skills

I feel most productive in an environment where these techniques are/can be applied and feel comfortable introducing them to teams. *Sorted by relevance.*

**Kanban, Retrospectives, GitHub based workflows, Continuous Integration/Delivery, Semantic Versioning, ESLint, npm (packaging, automation), pair programming, Pomodoro, test driven development, ...**

<br />

## Fields of Interest

I have little to no practical experience with these things but would love to work with people who have or on projects that utilize them. *Sorted by interest.*

I will give a discount when booked on projects where I can work with these and probably invest personal free time in learning them related to your product.

**Babel (custom plugins), (practical applied) domain driven design, serverless (framework and architectures), Artificial Neural Networks, webpack (custom plugins), AWS (from a Dev-Ops perspective), ...**

I might be rusty, or favour other methods and technologies but still feel productive when using these. *Sorted by experience*
