<h1 style="font-size: 3rem; line-height: 1.2">Hi! My name is Hannes. I’m a freelance JavaScript architect.</h1>

<br style="clear: both;" />

Modern web applications tend to be huge and complex systems, leading to an increasing amount of logic being moved into (web-)clients and nodejs. This is inflicting various new challenges to developers, which I strive to find the best solutions for.

I’m working in, observing and shaping companies that build big web apps for a good 5 years. I’m deeply interested in maintainability, scalability, automation, work culture and team building. Especially in frontend development teams. 

As a quick learner, I am able to pick up common best practices as well as the latest cutting edge concepts to tailor solutions for the specific problems we are facing. Whether is purely technical in code or more on a team/ company meta-level.

## My other lives

I love open source and tinkering around with all sorts of tech. Check out my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Xiphe).

I also write and talk about music and life on [hannesdiem.de](http://hannesdiem.de), and in the [Tagesform Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/tagesform-uber-die-musik-das/id1109789077) (both in German).

I sing and play a bunch of instruments with my bands [House on a Hill](http://houseonahill.de/) and [Absolem Max](https://www.absolem-max.com/).

I [write and publish songs](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2eaXfpAkFuTlmu5IsLhxMl) and [make videos about the process](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCONYaNqDnjsfxIjkWgd_f8w).

Everything I do, I do in the strong belief that we can make the world a better place through love and peace [![Love and Peace](http://love-and-peace.github.io/love-and-peace/badges/base/v1.0.svg)](https://github.com/love-and-peace/love-and-peace/blob/master/versions/base/v1.0/en.md).
