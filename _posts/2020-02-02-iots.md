title: Typing, converting and validating unknown input with io-ts

## TL;DR

This is not about the internet of things.

I'm currently evaluating [io-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/io-ts) to
handle `unknown` input (such as user configurations) in typescript projects.

## Context

I'm working on a command line utility for creating pdf files from
user input.

## Problem

When it comes to configuration I want to support a lot of different inputs
for configuration.[^1]

I want to support:

 - [cosmiconfig](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cosmiconfig)
 - Environment Variables (`FOO=bar`)
 - Command Line Arguments (`--foo=bar`)

But none of these produce anything reliable or event typed[^2] ðŸ˜±! 


## Idea

The main idea is to declare the shape of the (to be expected) configuration
in a way that not only produces a Typescript Type but also validates the input 
at runtime.

```ts
function app(input: unknown) {
  const configShape = {
    count: Number,
    deep: {
      stuff: String
    },
  };
  const config = validate(input, configShape);

  /* this should now work without type warnings */
  const num: number = config.count;
  const str: string = config.deep.stuff;
}

type Magic<S> = /* Recursively map NumberConstructor to number etc. */

function validate<S>(input: unknown, shape: S): Magic<S> {
  /* 
  throw Error when input is invalid
  maybe convert it and return it as correct type
  */
}
```

I already went down this road and even implemented optional types and arrays of 
single types but before I started working on unions and intersections
I stopped and searched npm again. 

## Solution

[`npm inatall io-ts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/io-ts)

...well I guess, I wrote this article before finishing the migration.

I wont get into details here but instead refer to the [well written documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/io-ts#installation)

```ts
import * as t from 'io-ts';
import { isLeft } from 'fp-ts/lib/Either'
import { ThrowReporter } from 'io-ts/lib/ThrowReporter'

function app(input: unknown) {
  const configShape = t.type({
    count: t.number,
    deep: t.type({
      stuff: t.string
    })
  });

  const c = configShape.decode(input);
  if (isLeft(c)) {
    throw ThrowReporter.report(c);
  }

  /* this should now work without type warnings */
  const num: number = c.right.count;
  const str: string = c.right.deep.stuff;
}
```

## Next

1. I don't really get the whole Either stuff and think it might be to bloated
   but thats to early to tell.
2. I would really like to also add documentation to the shape and have that 
   extracted automatically.
3. I need to somehow walk the shape to map it to Environment variables

[^1]: maybe this already is the problem and I should stop here...
[^2]: with the exception of ts config files thanks to [cosmiconfig-typescript-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@endemolshinegroup/cosmiconfig-typescript-loader) [which is slooow, but thats another story]
